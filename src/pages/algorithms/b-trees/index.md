B Trees are self balancing tree data strcutures. It allows searches, sequential access, insertion and deletions in logarithmic time.
They are commonly used in databases and filesystems to read and write large blocks of dat. In a way, B-trees are a generalization of a binary search tree on which nodes have more than two children.
